Avoid serious conditions by drinking plenty of water, and take frequent breaks if you're out in the sun for extended periods of time. If you can, wear light-colored clothing.</p>
      <p class="content">Make sure to stay hydrated and find some shade on the golf course every now and then. Keep the kids cool wherever you go by bringing along umbrellas and fans. Pack some extra water that you can use to wet rags and drape on the backs<span class="style5"><span class="style6"></span></span> everyone's necks.</p>
      <p class="content">Drink water before you're thirsty! Avoid consuming beverages with caffiene or alcohol while out in the sun because these types of drinks speed up dehydration.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><strong>Signs and symptoms of dehydration:</strong><br />
          • dry lips and tongue<br />
          • nausea<br />
          • weakness, dizziness or extreme fatigue<br />
          • muscle cramps<br />
          • headache</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="content">If you begin to feel any of these symptoms, take a break for a few minutes in the shade or an air conditioned building if possible, 
        and continue drinking lots of water.</p>

        <span class="subheader">How <em>NOT</em> to Need an Orthopedic Surgeon<br />
        <span class="style9">(and some other doctors, too) <em>— by Joseph E. Broyles, MD</em></span></span></p>
      <p class="content"><img style="margin-left:20px" src="http://www.boneandjointclinicbr.com/newsletter/060408/images/dr-broyles.gif" width="109" height="106" align="right" /><strong>Get Enough Vitamin D:</strong><br />
        Did you know that unless you have adequate levels of vitamin D, you can't absorb calcium well? In children, vitamin D deficiency causes a condition called Rickets. In adults, deficiency is called Osteomalacia, associated with weak bones.</p>
      <p class="content">Studies also show that adequate vitamin D intake or production from sunlight is associated with lower rates of just about all forms of cancer except skin cancer. The solution then is to protect your skin with sunscreen, but take vitamin D supplements to realize the health benefits.  So how much do you need?  Most multivitamins contain 400 I.U. of vitamin D.  Total body sun exposure produces 10,000 I.U. in a day.  I recommend getting a simple blood test to check your 25-hydroxy vitamin D level.   Optimum levels are probably around 50 ng/mL.  This level is attainable with 2000 I.U. a day with moderate sun exposure (and no sunscreen), or 4000 I.U. without sun exposure.  I have screened around 20 patients with this blood test.  One had a level of 50, one 37, and the rest were <30!  In fact, one of the ladies with a level in the 20’s is outside playing tennis several days a week (with lots of sunscreen on).
<span class="style5"><span class="style6"></span></span></p>
      <p class="content"><strong>Lift Weights:</strong><br />
        In orthopedics, Wolfe’s Law states that “Bone forms in response to stress.”  Use it or lose it.  Weight lifting is probably the best exercise for building or maintaining bone density.  Increased stress is placed on the bone both while doing the exercises and afterwards (because larger muscles exert more stress on the bones even while resting).      </p>
      <p class="content"><strong>If you have arthritis, take glucosamine and chondroitin:</strong><br />
        Many people take NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, etc for osteoarthritis.  They certainly do help with the pain and swelling associated with arthritis, but they do nothing to slow the progression.  What we really need is something that actually slows down the progression of the disease.  Glucosamine and chondroitin are two of the building blocks for joint cartilage.  Two good studies have shown that people who took them had less progression of arthritis of the knee on x-ray compared to a placebo group.  To be fair, a third study showed no effect.  Chondroitin does thin the blood some, so if you are on a blood thinner, it may not be a good idea to take it.      </p>

        — by Robert W. Dugas, MD</span></span></p>
      <p><img style="margin-right:20px" src="http://www.boneandjointclinicbr.com/newsletter/060408/images/dr-dugas.gif" width="107" height="121" align="left" /><span class="content">Dr. Robert Dugas is a former LSU All-American offensive tackle.  He completed a Sports Medicine Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin and served as a Team Physician for the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 1990-2006.  Dr. Dugas is accredited by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery as a Certified Sports Medicine Specialist.  </span></p>
      <p><span class="content">In this article, Dr. Dugas discusses the advantages of summer sports camps:</span></p>
      <p class="content">Summer sports camps allow a group of team members to participate in sport specific physiological conditioning, creating a great opportunity to form better team unity.  The training for each individual is directed to allow personal peak neuromuscular development in strength, agility and coordination.</p>
      <p class="content"> Conditioning programs should include repetitive demands placed on the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems.  These demands increase the ability of the cardiovascular system to bring nutrients to the muscles, which increases their endurance and strength.  Sport specific agility drills improve individual coordination, and controlled challenges under high temperature circumstances allow for extremely important heat acclimatization.</p>
      <p class="content"> Each sports camp will stress the physical and psychological needs of the athlete and allow for specific adjustments to meet their individual goals.</p>
